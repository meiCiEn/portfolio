The aim was to outline the programme, introduce the speaker, give practical details and provide a way of signing up for the event.</br></br>The one-page approach was designed to be accessible and clear, paying particular attention to those viewing the site on a smartphone. The colour scheme of the site takes its cue from a piece of artwork that had been chosen by the speaker as a focus for the event.",
