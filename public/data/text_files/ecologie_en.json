  "projectDescription": "The Maison de l'Écologie in Namur is a charity that promotes sustainability through workshops, children's holiday clubs and a large library of toys and board games. They turned to my coding school, Interface3, because they wanted a more coherent, attractive and user-friendly website. Soumaya Mhenni and I were tasked with redesigning the home page and navigation menu. <br /><br />Wordpress was an excellent choice for this project, as we needed an easy-to-use administration interface that would allow the organisation's staff to easily publish news articles and add events to the calendar.",
