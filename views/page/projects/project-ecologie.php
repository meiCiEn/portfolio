It approached my coding school, Interface3, because it wanted a website that was more coherent, attractive and user friendly. Soumaya Mhenni and I were charged with redesigning the homepage and navigation menu. <br />Wordpress was a great choice for this project, as we needed an administrator interface that was easy to use, and would enable staff at the organisation to easily publish news articles and add events to the calendar.";
